Version: 0.15.9
Description: A framework to help construct R data packages in a 
  reproducible manner. Potentially time consuming processing of 
  raw data sets into analysis ready data sets is done in a reproducible 
  manner and decoupled from the usual 'R CMD build' process so that
  data sets can be processed into R objects in the data package and 
  the data package can then be shared, built, and installed by others
  without the need to repeat computationally costly data processing.
  The package maintains data provenance by turning the data processing
  scripts into package vignettes, as well as enforcing documentation 
  and version checking of included data objects. Data packages can be
  version controlled on 'GitHub', and used to share data for manuscripts,
  collaboration and reproducible research.
