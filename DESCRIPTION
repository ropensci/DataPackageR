Description: A framework to help construct R data packages in a
    reproducible manner. Potentially time consuming processing of raw data
    sets into analysis ready data sets is done in a reproducible manner
    and decoupled from the usual 'R CMD build' process so that data sets
    can be processed into R objects in the data package and the data
    package can then be shared, built, and installed by others without the
    need to repeat computationally costly data processing.  The package
    maintains data provenance by turning the data processing scripts into
    package vignettes, as well as enforcing documentation and version
    checking of included data objects. Data packages can be version
    controlled on 'GitHub', and used to share data for manuscripts,
    collaboration and reproducible research.
