```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This file is processed second in the `config.yml` file. It therefore has access to the data objects
created by `subsetCars.Rmd`, the file that is processed first in the `config.yml`.

## Reading objects from previously run files

In order to read previously processed objects, we use the `datapackager_object_read()` API from `DataPackageR`:


```{r reading_from_environments}
library(DataPackageR)
cars_over_20 = datapackager_object_read("cars_over_20")
print(cars_over_20)
```

This API reads from an environment named `ENVS`, containing `subsetCars` and any other previously built data set objects. It is passed into the render environment of `extra.Rmd` by DataPackageR at the `render()` call.

## Additional data objects

This file will add the pressure data set to the example.

```{r}
data(pressure, envir = environment())
plot(pressure)
```
