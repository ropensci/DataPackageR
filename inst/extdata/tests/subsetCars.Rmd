```{r include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is a simple Rmd file that demonstrates how DataPackageR processes Rmarkdown files and creates data sets
that are then stored in an R data package.

In the `config.yml` for this example, this file is listed first, and therefore processed first.

This particular document simply subsets the `cars` data set:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
dim(cars)
```

`cars` consists of a data frame of 50 rows and two columns. The `?cars` documentation specifies that it consists of speed and stopping distances of cars.

Let's say, for some reason, we are only interested in the stopping distances of cars traveling greater than 20 miles per hour.

```{r}
cars_over_20 = subset(cars, speed > 20)
```

The data frame `cars_over_20` now holds this information.

# Storing data set objects and making making accessible to other processing scripts.

When DataPackageR processes this file, it creates this `cars_over_20` object. After processing the file it does several things:

1. It compares the objects in the rmarkdown render environment of `subsetCars.Rmd` against the objects listed in the `config.yml` file `objects` property.
2. It finds `cars_over_20` is listed there, so it stores it in a new environment.
3. That environment is passed to subsequent R and Rmd files. Specifically when the `extra.Rmd` file is processed, it has access to an environment object that holds all the `objects` (defined in the yaml config) that have already been created and processed. This environment is passed into subsequent scripts at the `render()` call.

All of the above is done automatically. The user only needs to list the objects to be stored and passed to other scripts in the `config.yml` file.

The `datapackager_object_read()` API can be used to retrieve these objects from the environment.

### Storing objects in the data package

In addition to passing around an environment to subsequent scripts, the `cars_over_20` object is stored in the data package `/data` directory as an `rda` file.

Note that this is all done automatically. The user does not need to explicitly save anything, they only need to list the objects to be store in the `config.yml`.

This object is then accessible in the resulting package via the `data()` API, and its documentation is accessible via `?cars_over_20`.

### Data object documentation

The documentation for the `cars_over_20` object is created in a `subsetCars.R` file in the `/R` directory of the data package.

While the data object document stub is created automatically, it must be edited by the user to provide additional details about the data object.
